# NAME

App::CISetup - opinionated setup for various CI systems

# DESCRIPTION

This is currently a pre-release version of some internal MaxMind code that we
use to configure github repos to run on various CI systems.

At this point it's really for informational purposes only (though it all works.)
It does things that aren't really suitable for public reuse including needing
a very recent version of perl, and enabling experimental Perl features.  YMMV.
